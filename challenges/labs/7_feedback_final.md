> Would be great to include full Kerberos+LDAP Lab, for example by omitting HDFS lab and some parts of Clients / Enterprise labs and course can take longer - from Monday morning to Friday afternoon.

* Describe the boot camp: was it useful, difficult, simple?
  > It was useful, it was difficult, but not something one could not handle.

* Which topic was least familiar to you? Which topic was most familiar?
  > Least familiar: KDC management, but after course, it is OK.  Most familiar: Installation.

* Which topic did you feel was most helpful? Which topic was not useful, if any?
  > Most helpful: Kerberos and Sentry, wish there is more time to continue with full LDAP setup. Least useful: Client API (REST) - something I can google for easily and design client against API easily. It is enough to mention that API exists.

* How long before you are ready to to install a production cluster by yourself? What do you need to work on?
  > If nothing else is on my TODO list, month would be sufficient (testing KDC+LDAP environment, Sentry) for myself.
